# Yo! In Flutter.

![yo_flutter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11478053/49794374-b1a1ce00-fd37-11e8-9364-9ec0efde9ca6.png)

Basically [Yo!](http://www.justyo.co/) written in Flutter. Done in a three hour workshop with people who never used Flutter before üçª

## Lesson 1

- Clone the project `git clone git@github.com:flutter-school/yo-flutter.git` and 
- run it `flutter run`

Flutter install instructions: 
- https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
- https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor

If you have trouble setting up flutter, ask for support

You've finished this lessen if you see the congratulations screen on your phone.

## Lesson 2

Create the list layout of your friends. Use the screenshot above as reference.

1. Create a `FriendsPage` widget. "Screen" are called "Pages" in Flutter.
2. Use the [`ListView.builder`](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/ListView-class.html) widget to show the items. 

Use the existing `Person` data class in `person.dart`.

Here are some helpful snippets:
```dart
final List<Person> friends = [
    Person("ffff", "Frederik Schweiger", "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1074391975820972033/SP7txc1D_400x400.jpg"),
    Person("pppp", "Pascal Welsch", "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/941273826557677568/wCBwklPP_400x400.jpg"),
    Person("gggg", "Georg Bednorz", "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1091439933716381701/PIfcpdHq_400x400.png"),
    Person("ssss", "Seth Ladd", "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/986316447293952000/oZWVUWDs_400x400.jpg"),
    Person("kkkk", "Kate Lovett", "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1048927764156432384/JxEqQ9dX_400x400.jpg"),
    Person("tttt", "Tim Sneath", "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/653618067084218368/XlQA-oRl_400x400.jpg"),
    Person("hhhh", "Filip Hr√°ƒçek", "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/796079953079111680/ymD9DY5g_400x400.jpg"),
    Person("aaaa", "Andrew Brogdon", "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/651444930884186112/9vlhNFlu_400x400.png"),
    Person("nnnn", "Nitya Narasimhan", "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/988808912504733697/z03gHVFL_400x400.jpg"),
];

List<Color> _colors = [
    Color(0xFFF8B195),
    Color(0xFFF67280),
    Color(0xFFC06C84),
    Color(0xFF6C5B7B),
    Color(0xFF355C7D),
    Color(0xFF34495D),
];
```

Build the login screen with [scoped_model](https://github.com/brianegan/scoped_model/)

Use the existing `SessionModel` in `session_model.dart` and register it globally in your `main` function.

```dart
final SessionModel sessionModel = SessionModel();
runApp(ScopedModel<SessionModel>(
  model: sessionModel,
  child: YoApp(),
  ));
```

Build a Widget which toggles between the `FriedsPage` and a `LoginPage` depending on the session state.
Use `ScopedModelDescendant` to access the `SessionModel`

```dart
ScopedModelDescendant<SessionModel>(
    builder: (BuildContext context, Widget child, SessionModel model) {
      // TODO use model
      return anyWidget;
    },
),
```

Lear how ScopedModel works under the hood: [InheritedWidgets and App-scope/Page-scope](https://medium.com/@mehmetf_71205/inheriting-widgets-b7ac56dbbeb1)

## Lesson 4 (optional)

We want to send YO!s to each other via push notifications. 
You need a apple developer account to make it work with iOS.
For now, we'll focus on Android to receive the notifications.

The android project is already fully connected to a instance firebase. 
If you want full access you have to create your own firebase project.

- Create the Android app
    - applicationId `school.flutter.yo`
    - SHA-1 `D2:6E:E8:94:62:5E:1D:74:C7:84:26:0A:32:8A:4E:26:2D:DD:FE:E4` (for existing key `flutterschool.jks`)
- (Create the iOS apps with `school.flutter.yo` as bundleId)


- Download the firebase configuration files to
    - `android/app/google-services.json` 
    - `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
    On iOS you need to edit `ios/Runner/Info.plist` and paste in your `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID`.

- Enable Google Authentication (`Develop -> Authentication -> Sign-in method -> Goolge -> Enable`) 



- Deploy firebase cloud functions, see `fireabse/README.md`

## Lesson 5

Show real users form firebase

1. Refactor your static `FriendsPage` and load your Friends from firebase. 
Don't put the Firebase loading code in the UI, create a page-scoped model (`FriendsModel`). 

Here's some code for you to start
```dart
class FriendsModel extends Model {
  /// Easy access to this model using [ScopedModel.of]
  static FriendsModel of(BuildContext context) =>
      ScopedModel.of<FriendsModel>(context);

  FriendsModel(this.userModel) {
    _loadFriends();
  }

  List<Person> get friends => _friends?.toList() ?? [];
  Iterable<Person> _friends;

  bool get isLoading => _friends == null;

  SessionModel userModel;

  Future<void> sendYo(Person person) async {
    // TODO
    throw "not implemented";
  }

  Future<void> _loadFriends() async {
    // TODO
    throw "not implemented";
  }
}
```

Now implement the data loading. 
This is how you get your friends form firebase.
(Don't forget to notify the UI after loading)
```dart
import 'package:cloud_firestore/cloud_firestore.dart';

final stream = Firestore.instance.collection(Person.REF).orderBy("name").snapshots();
stream.listen((QuerySnapshot snapshot) {
  final friends = snapshot.documents.map((data) => Person.fromJson(data.data));
});
```

## Lesson 6

Send push notifications

Register for firebase notifications after successful login
```dart
import 'package:firebase_messaging/firebase_messaging.dart';

final fmToken = await FirebaseMessaging().getToken();
Firestore.instance
    .collection("tokens")
    .document(_user.uid)
    .setData({'token': fmToken})
```

Tip: `print` a message with the users email address after successfully writing the token to firebase. 

## Lesson 7

Send yo! to another user

Implement `FriendsModel.sendYo` and call the firebase cloud function to notify other users that you think about them
```dart
await http.get('https://us-central1-yo-flutter-80f0f.cloudfunctions.net/sendYo?'
    'fromUid=${userModel.uid}&toUid=${person.uid}');
```

Caution: 
- You won't see a notification if the app is in foreground
- Test on a real device, not the emulator/simulator
- It doesn't work on iOS unless you've registered you APNs Authentication Key


## Bonus 1

Add a logout button to your app. 
Call `ScopedModel.of<SessionModel>(context).logout();` instead of creating a `ScopedModelDescendant`.

## Bonus 2

Rewrite the `FriendsModel` using immutable collections from [kt.dart](https://github.com/passsy/kt.dart)

## Disclaimer

Please note that this code is not production ready, it should just show how quick you could build a million dollar app for Android and iOS üòâ


## Finished app

If you run into trouble we have a working example for you. Run

```bash
flutter run lib/finished/finished.dart
```
